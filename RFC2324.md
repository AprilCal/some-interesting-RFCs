## 摘要
此文档描述了用于控制,监测,诊断咖啡壶的HTCPCP协议

## 1. Rationale and Scope

   咖啡遍布世界。在一个计算无处不在的世界中,计算机学家想要煮咖啡的意愿渐增。煮咖啡是种艺术,而由网络所连接的世界则超越了艺术.因此我们对于设计一个用于煮咖啡的协议的需求是非常强烈,黑暗,和丰富的。煮咖啡需要用到咖啡壶。网络咖啡壶用到协议来控制他们。  
   家庭与消费者的设备越来越多地连接到了因特网上。早期的网络实验演示了将贩卖设备连接到因特网上以便检测其状态[COKE]。作为最早的连接到因特网的远程操作机器之一,Internet Toaster(通过SNMP协议控制),在1990年首次推出[RFC2235]。
   无处不在的设备连接需求极大地消耗了IPv4地址空间。消费者希望远程控制咖啡壶之类的设备，以便他们醒来时就有刚煮好的咖啡享用，或是在晚餐准备完成后，在一个精确的时间准备好咖啡。  
   此文档描述一个超文本咖啡壶控制协议(HTCPCP),此协议包含了用于控制设备(制造含咖啡因热饮的设备)的全部请求和响应。  
   HTTP 1.1 ([RFC2068]) 允许将web对象从服务器传输到客户端。web是全球范围的。HTCPCP是基于HTTP协议的。这是因为HTTP应用广泛。如果HTTP不好，他不可能被如此广泛地应用。因此HTTP非常好。如果你想喝到好的咖啡，HTCPCP也需要设计的很好才行。为了设计好HTCPCP，最好令其基于HTTP。  
   此协议未来的版本中可能会包含扩展功能，以应用于咖啡机和相似的设备。  

## 2 HTCPCP协议
   HTCPCP协议是在HTTP上构建的，HTCPCP中增加了一些新的方法，首部字段以及返回码。所有的HTCPCP服务器应当通过"coffee:" URI模式引用(见第四节)。  

### 2.1 HTCPCP中增加的方法

#### 2.1.1 The BREW method, and the use of POST

   Commands to control a coffee pot are sent from client to coffee
   server using either the BREW or POST method, and a message body with
   Content-Type set to "application/coffee-pot-command".

   A coffee pot server MUST accept both the BREW and POST method
   equivalently.  However, the use of POST for causing actions to happen
   is deprecated.

   Coffee pots heat water using electronic mechanisms, so there is no
   fire. Thus, no firewalls are necessary, and firewall control policy
   is irrelevant. However, POST may be a trademark for coffee, and so
   the BREW method has been added. The BREW method may be used with
   other HTTP-based protocols (e.g., the Hyper Text Brewery Control
   Protocol).

2.1.2 GET method

   In HTTP, the GET method is used to mean "retrieve whatever
   information (in the form of an entity) identified by the Request-
   URI." If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is
   the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the
   response and not the source text of the process, unless that text
   happens to be the output of the process.

   In HTCPCP, the resources associated with a coffee pot are physical,
   and not information resources. The "data" for most coffee URIs
   contain no caffeine.

2.1.3 PROPFIND method

   If a cup of coffee is data, metadata about the brewed resource is
   discovered using the PROPFIND method [WEBDAV].

2.1.4 WHEN method

   When coffee is poured, and milk is offered, it is necessary for the
   holder of the recipient of milk to say "when" at the time when
   sufficient milk has been introduced into the coffee. For this
   purpose, the "WHEN" method has been added to HTCPCP. Enough? Say
   WHEN.

2.2 Coffee Pot Header fields

   HTCPCP recommends several HTTP header fields and defines some new
   ones.

2.2.1 Recommended header fields

2.2.1.1 The "safe" response header field.

   [SAFE] defines a HTTP response header field, "Safe", which can be
   used to indicate that repeating a HTTP request is safe. The inclusion
   of a "Safe: Yes" header field allows a client to repeat a previous
   request if the result of the request might be repeated.

   The actual safety of devices for brewing coffee varies widely, and
   may depend, in fact, on conditions in the client rather than just in
   the server. Thus, this protocol includes an extension to the "Safe"
   response header:

          Safe                = "Safe" ":" safe-nature
          safe-nature         = "yes" | "no" | conditionally-safe
          conditionally-safe  = "if-" safe-condition
          safe-condition      = "user-awake" | token

   indication will allow user agents to handle retries of some safe
   requests, in particular safe POST requests, in a more user-friendly
   way.

2.2.2 New header fields

2.2.2.1 The Accept-Additions header field

   In HTTP, the "Accept" request-header field is used to specify media
   types which are acceptable for the response. However, in HTCPCP, the
   response may result in additional actions on the part of the
   automated pot. For this reason, HTCPCP adds a new header field,
   "Accept-Additions":


       Accept-Additions = "Accept-Additions" ":"
                          #( addition-range [ accept-params ] )

        addition-type   = ( "*"
                          | milk-type
                          | syrup-type
                          | sweetener-type
                          | spice-type
                          | alcohol-type
                          ) *( ";" parameter )
        milk-type       = ( "Cream" | "Half-and-half" | "Whole-milk"
                          | "Part-Skim" | "Skim" | "Non-Dairy" )
        syrup-type      = ( "Vanilla" | "Almond" | "Raspberry"
                          | "Chocolate" )
        alcohol-type    = ( "Whisky" | "Rum" | "Kahlua" | "Aquavit" )

2.2.3 Omitted Header Fields

   No options were given for decaffeinated coffee. What's the point?

2.3 HTCPCP return codes

   Normal HTTP return codes are used to indicate difficulties of the
   HTCPCP server. This section identifies special interpretations and
   new return codes.

2.3.1 406 Not Acceptable

   This return code is normally interpreted as "The resource identified
   by the request is only capable of generating response entities which
   have content characteristics not acceptable according to the accept
   headers sent in the request. In HTCPCP, this response code MAY be
   returned if the operator of the coffee pot cannot comply with the
   Accept-Addition request. Unless the request was a HEAD request, the
   response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of available
   coffee additions.


   In practice, most automated coffee pots cannot currently provide
   additions.

2.3.2 418 I'm a teapot

   Any attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error
   code "418 I'm a teapot". The resulting entity body MAY be short and
   stout.

3. The "coffee" URI scheme

   Because coffee is international, there are international coffee URI
   schemes.  All coffee URL schemes are written with URL encoding of the
   UTF-8 encoding of the characters that spell the word for "coffee" in
   any of 29 languages, following the conventions for
   internationalization in URIs [URLI18N].

coffee-url  =  coffee-scheme ":" [ "//" host ]
                ["/" pot-designator ] ["?" additions-list ]

coffee-scheme = ( "koffie"                      ; Afrikaans, Dutch
                  | "q%C3%A6hv%C3%A6"          ; Azerbaijani
                  | "%D9%82%D9%87%D9%88%D8%A9" ; Arabic
               | "akeita"                   ; Basque
               | "koffee"                   ; Bengali
               | "kahva"                    ; Bosnian
               | "kafe"                     ; Bulgarian, Czech
               | "caf%C3%E8"                ; Catalan, French, Galician
                  | "%E5%92%96%E5%95%A1"       ; Chinese
                  | "kava"                     ; Croatian
               | "k%C3%A1va                 ; Czech
               | "kaffe"                    ; Danish, Norwegian, Swedish
               | "coffee"                   ; English
               | "kafo"                     ; Esperanto
                  | "kohv"                     ; Estonian
               | "kahvi"                    ; Finnish
               | "%4Baffee"                 ; German
               | "%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%86%CE%AD" ; Greek
               | "%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8C%E0%A4%AB%E0%A5%80" ; Hindi
               | "%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%92%E3%83%BC" ; Japanese
               | "%EC%BB%A4%ED%94%BC"       ; Korean
               | "%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B5" ; Russian
               | "%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%9F" ; Thai
               )

   pot-designator = "pot-" integer  ; for machines with multiple pots
   additions-list = #( addition )
   
   All alternative coffee-scheme forms are equivalent.  However, the use
   of coffee-scheme in various languages MAY be interpreted as an
   indication of the kind of coffee produced by the coffee pot.  Note
   that while URL scheme names are case-independent, capitalization is
   important for German and thus the initial "K" must be encoded.

4. The "message/coffeepot" media type

   The entity body of a POST or BREW request MUST be of Content-Type
   "message/coffeepot". Since most of the information for controlling
   the coffee pot is conveyed by the additional headers, the content of
   "message/coffeepot" contains only a coffee-message-body:

   coffee-message-body = "start" | "stop"

5. Operational constraints

   This section lays out some of the operational issues with deployment
   of HTCPCP ubiquitously.

5.1 Timing Considerations

   A robust quality of service is required between the coffee pot user
   and the coffee pot service.  Coffee pots SHOULD use the Network Time
   Protocol [NTP] to synchronize their clocks to a globally accurate
   time standard.

   Telerobotics has been an expensive technology. However, with the
   advent of the Cambridge Coffee Pot [CAM], the use of the web (rather
   than SNMP) for remote system monitoring and management has been
   proven.  Additional coffee pot maintenance tasks might be
   accomplished by remote robotics.

   Web data is normally static. Therefore to save data transmission and
   time, Web browser programs store each Web page retrieved by a user on
   the user's computer. Thus, if the user wants to return to that page,
   it is now stored locally and does not need to be requested again from
   the server. An image used for robot control or for monitoring a
   changing scene is dynamic. A fresh version needs to be retrieved from
   the server each time it is accessed.

5.2 Crossing firewalls

   In most organizations HTTP traffic crosses firewalls fairly easily.
   Modern coffee pots do not use fire. However, a "firewall" is useful
   for protection of any source from any manner of heat, and not just
   fire. Every home computer network SHOULD be protected by a firewall
   from sources of heat. However, remote control of coffee pots is

   important from outside the home. Thus, it is important that HTCPCP
   cross firewalls easily.

   By basing HTCPCP on HTTP and using port 80, it will get all of HTTP's
   firewall-crossing virtues. Of course, the home firewalls will require
   reconfiguration or new versions in order to accommodate HTCPCP-
   specific methods, headers and trailers, but such upgrades will be
   easily accommodated. Most home network system administrators drink
   coffee, and are willing to accommodate the needs of tunnelling
   HTCPCP.

6. System management considerations

   Coffee pot monitoring using HTTP protocols has been an early
   application of the web.  In the earliest instance, coffee pot
   monitoring was an early (and appropriate) use of ATM networks [CAM].

   The traditional technique [CAM] was to attach a frame-grabber to a
   video camera, and feed the images to a web server. This was an
   appropriate application of ATM networks. In this coffee pot
   installation, the Trojan Room of Cambridge University laboratories
   was used to give a web interface to monitor a common coffee pot.  of
   us involved in related research and, being poor, impoverished
   academics, we only had one coffee filter machine between us, which
   lived in the corridor just outside the Trojan Room. However, being
   highly dedicated and hard-working academics, we got through a lot of
   coffee, and when a fresh pot was brewed, it often didn't last long.

   This service was created as the first application to use a new RPC
   mechanism designed in the Cambridge Computer Laboratory - MSRPC2. It
   runs over MSNL (Multi-Service Network Layer) - a network layer
   protocol designed for ATM networks.

   Coffee pots on the Internet may be managed using the Coffee Pot MIB
   [CPMIB].

7. Security Considerations

   Anyone who gets in between me and my morning coffee should be
   insecure.

   Unmoderated access to unprotected coffee pots from Internet users
   might lead to several kinds of "denial of coffee service" attacks.
   The improper use of filtration devices might admit trojan grounds.
   Filtration is not a good virus protection method.

   Putting coffee grounds into Internet plumbing may result in clogged
   plumbing, which would entail the services of an Internet Plumber
   [PLUMB], who would, in turn, require an Internet Plumber's Helper.

   Access authentication will be discussed in a separate memo.
