             IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of Service

## 摘要
此文档以服务质量（QoS）信息修正RFC1149，“鸟类链路上的数据报传输标准”。这是一个实验性的，不推荐的标准。

## 概论
下列是可选的服务质量级别：协和式飞机，头等舱，商务舱，经济舱。协和飞机等级的服务提供高速数据传递。使用鸟类的一个好处是它是唯一一种比通常飞行物快上几英里的网络技术，加上协和飞机以及头等舱级别的服务，每个数据包快上一半。鸵鸟是另一种载体，它有更大的负载能力，但是传输速度也更慢，并且在不同的域（domain）之间需要使用桥（bridge）。

服务级别是通过标记在机翼上的条形码，在每个载体的基础上进行标记的。一个实现策略是使用读码器扫描进入路由的载体，将其入队到适当的队列，直到适当时机才令其离开。在排队的时候，载体可能会睡着。<br>

对于安全网络而言，载体分为极佳级和特选级。极佳级别的鸟类在使用公匙加密时可以自我控制（self-keying）。一些批发商经常会错分特选和极佳级的载体。

   Carriers in the queue too long may leave log entries, as shown on the
   scale.

   The following is a plot of traffic shaping, from coop-erative host
   sites.

   Avian carriers normally bypass bridges and tunnels but will seek out
   worm hole tunnels.  When carrying web traffic, the carriers may
   digest the spiders, leaving behind a more compact representation.
   The carriers may be confused by mirrors.

   Round-robin queueing is not recommended.  Robins make for well-tuned
   networks but do not support the necessary auto-homing feature.

   A BOF was held at the last IETF but only Avian Carriers were allowed
   entry, so we don't know the results other than we're sure they think
   MPLS is great.  Our attempts at attaching labels to the carriers have
   been met with resistance.

   NATs are not recommended either -- as with many protocols, modifying
   the brain-embedded IP addresses is difficult, plus Avian Carriers MAY
   eat the NATs.

   Encapsulation may be done with saran wrappers.  Unintentional
   encapsulation in hawks has been known to occur, with decapsulation
   being messy and the packets mangled.

   Loose source routes are a viable evolutionary alternative enhanced
   standards-based MSWindows-compliant technology, but strict source
   routes MUST NOT be used, as they are a choke-point.

   The ITU has offered the IETF formal alignment with its corresponding
   technology, Penguins, but that won't fly.

   Multicasting is supported, but requires the implementation of a clone
   device.  Carriers may be lost if they are based on a tree as it is
   being pruned.  The carriers propagate via an inheritance tree.  The
   carriers have an average TTL of 15 years, so their use in expanding
   ring searches is limited.

   Additional quality of service discussion can be found in a Michelin's
   guide.

   The carriers will not line up in lexigraphic order but will
   naturally order in a large V shape.  Bulk retrieval is possible
   using the Powerful Get-Net operator.

Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

   MUST NOT  Usually not.

   SHOULD    Only when Marketing insists.

   MAY       Only if it doesn't cost extra.

## 安全考虑
对于大便的鸽子而言，有隐私问题。

恐旷症的鸟类在操作上非常不安全。

## 专利考虑
目前正在进行是有关先有的技术是鸟还是蛋的诉讼。
